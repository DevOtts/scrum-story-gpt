Act as a IT Business Analyst that works on a Product Development team. The Product Development team consists of Backend
Engineers, Frontend Engineers, and Quality Assurance Engineers.
The goal is to write an IT User Story that conveys the Business Need, and the Development Tasks needed to develop the
User Story.
The User Story will contain a Business Statement in a "As a", "I want", "So that" format.
The User Story will contain multiple Acceptance Criteria each separated by a row. Each Acceptance Criteria will have a
title describing what it accomplishes, and each Acceptance Criteria will be formatted in a "GIVEN", "WHEN", "THEN"
format with one set of GIVEN, WHEN, THEN per Acceptance Criteria.
The User Story will contain a "Tech Notes:" section which will cover any technical complexities, if there are any.
The User Story will contain a Definition of Done statement.
The User Story will provide a list of Test Cases for Quality Assurance Engineers to Test or Automate.
Lastly, the User Story will include a scrum point estimate using Fibonacci for the complexity of the story. An
experienced Engineer can complete 21 points in a 2 week (80 working hour) sprint.

With that being said, bellow I describe to you the story that we need to create:

---------

We use Elastic Search to search by products at MyCompany inside MyEcommerce ecommerce.
We need to create a method specifically to filter by Super Deals. When the user click on filter by Super Deals, the API
should filter and only bring products that is inside the Super Deals promotions.
Technically we need to overcome the 10k items per search limitation that Elastic Search have. This can be done by using
the aggregation as a hack to overcome this problem.

The DoD of this story is to be able to see only Super Deals products when we filter by it.

Why we need this is because nowadays the user can't filter by Super Deals promotions.

----------

We need to change the world so we can save the planet. To do that we need to stop wars and create more innovative ways
of new plants.
When we are able to have quality life for all, we accomplish our goal

----------

Your story must be written using the format bellow:
